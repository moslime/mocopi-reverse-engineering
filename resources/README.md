uart-tx - the pin circled in red prints debug data at 115200 baud. the best way to get to it without opening the tracker 
is to just attach a sewing needle to a usb-uart adapter and poke it. for ground, you can put the tracker in the case then just use the ground of a USB cable. this 
has the added benefit of making it easier to hold the tracker\

no-magnetic-drift - short vid showing that magnets dont affect tracking
